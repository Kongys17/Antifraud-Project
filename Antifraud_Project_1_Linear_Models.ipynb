    "Linear models perform poorly due to their linear nature. They tend to give small prediction results given that the number of postive cases are too small compared to its negative counterparts, and thus the linear regressors tend to ignore positive cases. Ensembling linear models with undersampling solves the inbalanced data problem partly, but the performance of the models (judging by its precision, recall and accuracy) is still unsatisfactory and an informed guess would blame it on the linear neture of the models, since the relationship of our target and features are hardly linear."

Thus, I suggest we treat linear models simply as a baseline methods and turn to other nonlinear classifiers."
